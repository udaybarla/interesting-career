# Interesting Career

Interesting Career is a project started to create awareness in high-school students about career options one can pursue. This helps them to look into various fields before starting their Pre University (XI & XII). 

## Website

Once we hit the mark of 99 career options, we will up our website, so students can browse through them with ease. Till we reach this goal we will stick to github.
